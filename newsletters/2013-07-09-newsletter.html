						<h3>{{ page.title }} - Patriotism Edition</h3>
						<p class="lead">Thank You!</p>
						<p>First, <b>thank you</b>, because of all <b>your</b> sharing, emailing, tweeting and facebooking, CityBits' launch has been great. I don't know how to express this over email, but launching was a leap for me, your support has made the other side of that leap a pretty wonderful place to be.</p>

						<p>Which brings me to the next exciting piece of news, we're having a vote!</p>

						<p class="callout">You vote! What should come next?<br>
							<br>1. Finish <b>Boston</b> you lazy bum.
							<br>2. I plan on purchasing a mansion in <b>Newport, RI</b>, so would you kindly get on it?
							<br>3. I hear <b>Chicago</b> is a regular tourist trap in the winter, get it done now!
							<br><br>
							<a href=mailto:ren@citybitsapp.com>Email</a> your votes. I promise they will be counted by humans, just none of those patriots from Florida.
						</p>
						
						<p class="lead">Coffee, Coffee, Buzz, Buzz!</p>
						<p>This month found us in Amherst, MA. We've long heard about the coffee shops in and around the 'herst (yeah, we might have just made that up). In brief, our first takes:</p>
						<p>We coffee'ed at <strong>Rao's</strong> (<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/raos-coffee-amherst">Yelp</a>).  Besides a website that won't load, Rao's makes an excellent latte and is just a beautiful place to go. Cold brew aficionados note that this is the real deal. Mocha lovers, be sure to order a little of that homemade whipped cream on top.</p>
						<p>After a nice walk, in the name of research, we re-coffee'ed (how is that for making a made up word longer?) at <strong>Amherst Coffee</strong> (<a href="http://highercup.com">http://highercup.com</a>), which is a place I could have spent the day and the evening. Excellent espresso drinks, with a full bar that opens at 3pm. We didn't have time for a drink, but the always "&agrave; point" Mel &amp; Whit gave them a hearty stamp of approval.</p>
						<p>If Amherst starts to feel a little small, head out of town to <strong>The Lady Killigrew Cafe</strong> (<a href="http://theladykilligrew.com/gallery/album/1/#!prettyPhoto">photos</a>) in Montague, MA.  The Lady Killigrew is a beauty overlooking the water. Adjoining the <a href="http://www.montaguebookmill.com">Montague Book Mill</a>, there is a lot to love. Their restaurant, <a href="http://montaguenightkitchen.com/">The Night Kitchen</a>, receives rave reviews.</p>

						<p>
							That's all, remember to be a patriot and vote!<br>
